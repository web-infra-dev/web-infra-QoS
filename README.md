## Metrics

### Bundle Size

The size of the bundles after the build.

- `minified-bundle-size`: the compressed size of bundles.
- `gzipped-bundle-size`: the size of bundles after compression & gzip.
- `dist-size`: file size of output in module.
- `gzipped-dist-size`: file size of output in module after gzip.
- `initial-js-size`: initial js size in rspress.
- `gzip-initial-js-size`: initial js size in rspress after gzip.
- `cjs-bundle-size`: the size of cjs formats outputs.
- `cjs-gzip-bundle-size`: the size of cjs formats outputs after gzip.
- `esm-bundle-size`: the size of esm formats outputs.
- `esm-gzip-bundle-size`: the size of esm formats outputs after gzip.

### Build Performance

- `dev-plugin-setup-time`: the time it takes from the start of the dev command to the completion of loading all plugins. Corresponding hooks: `loadConfig -> loadPlugin`.
- `dev-prepare-time`: the time taken from the time the plugins are loaded to the time when the build prep process is fully completed. Corresponding hooks: `loadPlugin -> prepare`.
- `dev-cold-boot-time`: the time it takes for the dev build to complete without caching. Corresponding hooks: `beforeDev -> afterDev`.
- `dev-hot-boot-time`: the time taken to complete the dev build with cache. Corresponding hooks: `beforeDev -> afterDev`.
- `build-plugin-setup-time`: the time taken from the start of the build command until all plugins have been loaded. Corresponding hooks: `loadConfig -> loadPlugin`.
- `build-prepare-time`: the time taken from when the plugins are loaded to when the build prep process is fully completed. Corresponding hooks: `loadPlugin -> prepare`.
- `build-cold-boot-time`: the time it takes for the build to complete without caching. Corresponding hooks: `beforeBuild -> afterBuild`.
- `build-hot-boot-time`: the time it takes to complete a build with caching. Corresponding hooks: `beforeBuild -> afterBuild`.
- `build-cjs-time`: the time it takes to complete a build task for cjs in module build. Corresponding hooks: `beforeBuildTask -> afterBuildTask`.
- `build-esm-time`: the time it takes to complete a build task for esm in module build. Corresponding hooks: `beforeBuildTask -> afterBuildTask`.
- `build-dts-time`: the time it takes to complete a build task for dts in module build. Corresponding hooks: `beforeBuildTask -> afterBuildTask`.
- `build-cjs-js-time`: the js bundle time it takes to complete a build task for cjs in Rslib.
- `build-esm-js-time`: the js bundle time it takes to complete a build task for esm in Rslib.
- `build-cjs-total-time`: the total time it takes to complete a build task for cjs in Rslib.
- `build-esm-total-time`: the total time it takes to complete a build task for esm in Rslib.
- `route-generate-time`: the time it takes to generate routes in rspress. Corresponding hooks: `beforeBuild -> routeGenerated`.
- `before-dev-time`: the time it takes for the dev command to initialize, in other words, cli cold boot time.
- `before-build-time`: the time it takes for the build command to initialize, in other words, cli cold boot time.

### Install Size

Install npm dependency related metrics.

- `install-size`: the size of node_modules after yarn install .
- `cold-install-time`: yarn install time, with cache and lock file.
- `hot-install-time`: yarn install time, without cache and lock file.
- `dependencies-count`: the total number of dependencies after yarn install.
