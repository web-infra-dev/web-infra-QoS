## How to use

Generating the preview page requires the following two steps:

### 1. Create a new directory and configure frontmatter

For example, create the following directories and files

```bash
├── docs
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── api
│   │   ├── index.md
│   │   ├── theme
│   │   │  ├── component.mdx
│   │   │  ├── utils.mdx
// ...
```

We add the following to `api/index.md`:

```md
---
overview: true
---
```

### 2. Configuring `_meta.json`

The content structure of the preview page will be automatically generated according to `_meta.json` and the corresponding h1, h2 titles of the article. For example, the configuration of `api/_meta.json` is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "dir",
    "name": "theme",
    "label": "Theme"
  }
]
```

At the same time, the file `api/theme/_meta.json` has the following content:

```json
["component", "utils"]
```

> The detailed configuration usage of `_meta.json` can be referred to [Auto Nav/Sidebar](/guide/basic/auto-nav-sidebar).

In the above configuration, the final preview page will generate a group called `Theme`, which contains the h1, h2 titles of two articles: `component.md(x)` and `utils.md(x)`. Of course, you can also refer to the config of the `Theme` group to add more groups.
